This documents how to deploy the application.

## Deploying the Deno application

[Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy) is a globally distributed platform for serverless JavaScript applications, and it is where we will be hosting our Deno application. You can choose from the different deployment options from the [official manual](https://docs.deno.com/deploy/manual), but the easiest way is by [linking it to your GitHub account](https://docs.deno.com/deploy/manual#option-2-start-with-an-existing-app).

> **NOTE:** Make sure to add your required environment variables to your project settings, as described in the [official manual](https://docs.deno.com/deploy/manual/environment-variables).
