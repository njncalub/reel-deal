# Deployment

This documents how to deploy the application.

## Provisioning the Database Instance

This application uses [SurrealDB](https://surrealdb.com/) for its database. The easiest way to provision it is by creating a free instance on [Fly.io](https://fly.io/). You can check the [official documentation](https://surrealdb.com/docs/deployment/fly) for more information.

## Deploying the Deno application

[Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy) is a globally distributed platform for serverless JavaScript applications, and it is where we will be hosting our Deno application. You can choose from the different deployment options from the [official manual](https://docs.deno.com/deploy/manual).
